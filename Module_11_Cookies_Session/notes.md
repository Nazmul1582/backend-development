### 11.1.1 Stateless HTTP nature and introduction to Cookie

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the fundamental language/protocol of the World Wide Web, defining rules for how web browsers (clients) request, send, and receive data (like web pages, images, videos) from web servers, working as a request-response system to power most internet communication. It's an application-layer protocol that allows users to browse, stream, download, and use web apps by facilitating the transfer of hypertext (linked text/media).
