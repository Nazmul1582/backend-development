## 11.1 Session Cookie with HTTP

### 11.1.1 Stateless HTTP nature and introduction to Cookie

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the fundamental language/protocol of the World Wide Web, defining rules for how web browsers (clients) request, send, and receive data (like web pages, images, videos) from web servers, working as a request-response system to power most internet communication. It's an application-layer protocol that allows users to browse, stream, download, and use web apps by facilitating the transfer of hypertext (linked text/media).

**HTTP is a Stateless Protocol**

### Key aspects

- **Foundation of the Web:** It's the core protocol for exchanging information across the internet.
- **Stateless:** Each request is generally independent, though sessions maintain context.
- **Methods:** Actions like GET (fetch), POST (send data), PUT (update), DELETE (remove) define intent.
- **Security (HTTPS):** A secure, encrypted version (HTTP Secure) uses SSL/TLS to protect data, now standard for most sites (using port 443 instead of 80).
- **Evolution:** HTTP has evolved (HTTP/2, HTTP/3) for better performance, security, and efficiency.
